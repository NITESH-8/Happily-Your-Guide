      <h1 class="home-heading">About Uttarakhand </h1>
      <p>The 27th state of Republic of India, Devbhoomi Uttarakhand that was formed in the year 2000 after being
        separated from the large state of Uttar Pradesh, is a destination to explore the riches of Indian culture,
        history, and natural beauty. The state that borders Tibet to the north; Nepal to the east; the state of Uttar
        Pradesh to the south; and Himachal Pradesh to the west and north-west, is divided into regions, Garhwal and
        Kumaon, which further break into 13 districts. Earlier, the state was named Uttaranchal by Bhartiya Janta Party
        (BJP) led central government and Uttar Pradesh State Government when they started a fresh round of state
        reorganisation in 1998. However, in 2006, Union Cabinet of India to the agreed to the demands of the Uttaranchal
        Legislative Assembly and leading members of the Uttarakhand Statehood Movement and renamed Uttaranchal as
        Uttarakhand. The state also finds its mention in history as a part of the Kuru and the Panchal kingdoms
        (mahajanpads) during the Vedic age. In Hindu mythology also, Uttarakhand has been recognized as a part of the
        famed Kedarkhand (Now Garhwal) and Manaskhand (Kumaon). It is also believed the famous sage Vyas composed the
        epic of Mahabharata in Uttarakhand. The signs of the practise of Shaivism in ancient times along with Buddhism
        and Folk Shamanic religion was also found in the state.

      <h1 class="home-heading">History Of Uttarakhand </h1>
      <p>Uttarakhand is a state in North India. Its name, which means "northern land" or "section" in Sanskrit, is
        mentioned in early Hindu texts as the combined region of Kedarkhand and Manaskhand.

        In the Puranas, Uttarakhand was the ancient term for the central Indian Himalayas. Its peaks and valleys were
        known as Svarga loka: a temporary abode of the righteous, and the source of the Ganges. Around 200 BC, the Khas
        Arya people reached the Himalayas from the Caucasus Mountains. Unlike the Vedic Aryans (who took southern,
        western, and eastern routes), the Khas Arya took the northern route. Uttarakhand is known as "the land of the
        gods" (Devbhumi) because of its number of Hindu pilgrimage sites. The Pauravas, Kushanas, Kunindas, Guptas,
        Katyuris, Palas, Chands, Parmars (or Panwars), Shahs and the British have ruled the state by turns</p>

      <h1 class="home-heading">Geography Of Uttarakhand </h1>
      <p>Uttarakhand has a total geographical area of 53,483 kmÂ², of which 86% is mountainous and 65% is covered by
        forest.[1] Most of the northern parts of the state are part of Greater Himalayan ranges also known as Himadri,
        covered by the high Himalayan peaks and glaciers, while the lower foothills were densely forested till denuded
        by the British log merchants and later, after independence, by forest contractors. Recent efforts in
        afforestation, however, have been successful in restoring the situation to some extent. The unique Himalayan
        ecosystem plays host to many animals (including bharal, snow leopards, leopards and tigers), plants and rare
        herbs. Two of the India's great rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna take birth in the glaciers of Uttarakhand
        state, and are fed by myriad lakes, glacial melts and streams.[2]It is fed by Ganges and Yamuna rivers</p>
